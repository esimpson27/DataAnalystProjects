Airbnb - A client was interested in purchasing an Airbnb property and wanted me to look into the best property to purchase. I compared zipcodes to the average sales per zip code. This allowed me to show the client which areas were most profitable. I then compared the average sales to the amount of bedrooms per rental. There was a correlation between higher sales and more bedrooms. There was also less competition for rentals with more bedrooms. If the client wishes to look further, we can use the data to analyze further.
